# Java Command Line RPG

Here is a project I created in 2018 when I first began my journey into coding. I created this story based on my dog, Luna, and her made up adventures through a fantasy setting. This game was created before I knew about important programming techniques and principles such as: inheritance, efficient error handling, and code reuse but I wanted to show it as a benchmark from where I was to where I am now.
